# AQI_ANALYSIS
This Power BI project analyzes air pollution trends (AQI) across different time periods, including:  COVID-19 Impact (Pre-COVID, Lockdown, Post-Lockdown) Festival Pollution Trends (Diwali, Holi, New Year)

# Air Quality Analysis - COVID & Festivals Impact (Power BI Dashboard)

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes **air pollution trends (AQI)** across different time periods, including:
- **COVID-19 Impact** (Pre-COVID, Lockdown, Post-Lockdown)
- **Festival Pollution Trends** (Diwali, Holi, New Year)



## 📊 Key Features

### ✅ COVID-19 Impact Analysis
- **Line Chart**: AQI trend before, during, and after lockdown.
- **Bar Chart**: Pollution comparison across different COVID phases.
- **Heatmap**: City-wise AQI variation during lockdown.

### ✅ Festival Pollution Analysis
- **Diwali vs. Normal Days**: AQI spikes due to firecrackers.
- **Holi Pollution**: Chemical pollutants and air quality changes.
- **New Year AQI Trends**: Impact of fireworks on air pollution.

### ✅ Interactive Filters & Slicers
- Filter AQI data by **COVID Period** (Pre-COVID, Lockdown, Post-Lockdown).
- Select AQI trends by **Festival (Diwali, Holi, New Year)** for easy comparison.

## 📈 Expected Insights
- **Lockdown (March–June 2020):** Significant AQI reduction due to fewer vehicles and industrial shutdowns.
- **Post-Lockdown:** Pollution levels gradually rising as activities resumed.
- **Diwali Pollution:** Sharp spike in **PM2.5 & PM10** due to firecrackers.
- **Holi Impact:** Chemical pollutants affecting air quality.
- **New Year AQI:** Temporary spikes due to fireworks.
